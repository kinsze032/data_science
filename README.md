# Data Science Projects
This repository is a collection of projects where I explore and learn the world of **Data Science**. The projects involve working with various tools and techniques, including data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

## 1. Project: employee departures and factor analysis.
In this project, I explore a dataset and perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create visualizations to gain insights.

 - data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/employee-attrition-and-factors
 - purpose: to gauge sentiment among the organization's employees in the context of their ability to be promoted or leave
 - libraries: **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**
 - using the Jupyter Notebook for **data analysis and visualization** in **Python**

## 2. Project: deforestation and fire analysis.
In this project, I use Tableau to create dashboards and interactive visualizations to represent complex data in an accessible format.
 - data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbogernetto/brazilian-amazon-rainforest-degradation
 - using **Tableau**.

## 3. Project - Machine Learning Models  
This project will focus on building machine learning models to solve a specific problem (e.g. classification, regression) using scikit-learn and Jupyter Notebook.
